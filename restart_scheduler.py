"""
restart_scheduler.py – rolling redeploy scheduler.

Spec point 11 (Aug 2026): the bot force-redeploys itself every
config.REDEPLOY_INTERVAL_HOURS hours, measured from the last actual
redeploy/resumption — NOT anchored to a fixed clock time. Replaces the
previous fixed-Africa/Nairobi-midnight schedule (_next_nairobi_midnight()),
which ignored config.REDEPLOY_INTERVAL_HOURS entirely and always fired once
a day regardless of what that config value was set to.

Public interface (unchanged contract with bot_engine.py):
  - is_redeploy_pending() -> bool
        True once the rolling timer has fired and a redeploy is due.
        bot_engine.py's _main_loop() checks this to pause taking on new
        trades, and _settle_loop() checks it to know when to start
        draining open contracts before actually redeploying.
  - trigger_redeploy() -> None
        Called by bot_engine.py's _settle_loop() ONLY once every open
        contract has been actively, confirmably closed (or the drain
        window has been exceeded and the redeploy is being delayed —
        in which case this is NOT called, see bot_engine.py Fix G).
        Actually fires the Render deploy hook and clears the pending flag.
  - run_scheduler() -> coroutine
        The rolling timer loop itself. Started as a background task by
        bot_engine.py's run() alongside its other loops.

Draining coordination lives entirely in bot_engine.py (it owns the open
contracts and the reconciliation / Multiplier max-hold machinery) — this
module only owns the schedule and the actual deploy-hook trigger.

    Fires the Render deploy hook (if configured) and clears the pending

    actively, confirmably closed.

    FIX (Task 7 — root cause of the 5h37m-without-redeploy incident,
    confirmed by code inspection): when RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL isn't set
    in the deployed environment, this used to clear `_pending` and quietly
    return — no actual redeploy happens, but the rolling timer in
    run_scheduler() sees `_pending` go False and starts a fresh
    REDEPLOY_INTERVAL_HOURS window right then, as if a real redeploy had
    just occurred. The process just keeps running and keeps trading,
    indefinitely, with the scheduler's own logs looking completely normal
    ("next redeploy at ..." every cycle) — this fully explains the
    symptom: at the 3h mark the drain likely finished quickly, this
    silent no-op fired, trading resumed immediately, and the next ~2h37m
    of trading happened before the process was presumably restarted by
    some external/manual trigger rather than this mechanism.

    Now: a missing hook URL is logged at CRITICAL with an unmissable
    banner (not a routine warning line) and pushed to the dashboard, and
    `_last_confirmed_redeploy_at` — the baseline the new watchdog below
    uses — is deliberately NOT updated on this path, only on an actual
    successful hook fire. `_last_triggered_at` (this function having run
    at all, success or not) is kept separately for existing behavior/logs.
