main.py – Entry point for the SIFM Deriv Trading Bot on Render.

Architecture:
  • Thread 1 (main) : Flask web server for Render's health checks —
                       always running, regardless of fixed-cycle phase.
  • Thread 2        : asyncio event loop running the bot engine — only
                       started while fixed_cycle.py's cycle is in its
                       TRADING phase (see below).
  • Thread 3        : self-ping keep-alive (pings /health every 40 s) —
                       always running, so Render sees a healthy service
                       24/7 even while the bot is deliberately not
                       connected to Deriv during the cooldown between
                       cycles.
  • Thread 4        : restart scheduler (rolling redeploy every
                       config.REDEPLOY_INTERVAL_HOURS) — only started in
                       the TRADING phase.
  • Thread 5        : fixed-cycle cooldown supervisor — only started
                       while the cycle is in its COOLDOWN phase, or the
                       instant TRADING transitions into COOLDOWN
                       (started from inside fixed_cycle.py itself in
                       that case, not from here).

Fixed two-leg trading cycle (Sep 2026, chat-requested, see
fixed_cycle.py — supersedes the old balance-trend Donkey ORIGINAL/RAW
switch and the profit-target cycle, neither of which is imported
anywhere anymore; Donkey Strategy itself now runs ORIGINAL only, RAW is
disabled, see signal_engine._donkey_active_variant()): trading runs
forever on a simple fixed pattern that no balance, profit, drawdown, or
time-of-day condition can alter —
  1. Trade for config.FIXED_CYCLE_LEG_MINUTES ("leg 1"). config.
     REDEPLOY_INTERVAL_HOURS is already set to this same 5 minutes, so
     the ordinary rolling-redeploy mechanism below IS leg 1's timer.
  2. Ordinary redeploy: drain open contracts, redeploy, resume trading
     immediately as leg 2 — no deliberate disconnect beyond the redeploy
     itself.
  3. Trade for FIXED_CYCLE_LEG_MINUTES again ("leg 2").
  4. Drain open contracts, then disconnect from Deriv entirely for
     config.FIXED_CYCLE_COOLDOWN_MINUTES (health checks only), then
     redeploy back into a fresh leg 1.
  5. Repeat forever.

main.py's only job for this is deciding, once per boot, whether this
deploy should start the bot at all or just sit in cooldown — everything
else lives in fixed_cycle.py, signal_engine.py and bot_engine.py.

Environment variables required:
  DERIV_API_TOKEN        – your Deriv API token (trade + read scope)
  DERIV_APP_ID           – your Deriv app ID  (default 1089 = demo)
  RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL    – set automatically by Render  (e.g. https://yourapp.onrender.com)
  PORT                   – set automatically by Render   (default 8080)
  RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL – deploy hook URL from Render dashboard (required
                            for the fixed-cycle cooldown to actually
                            redeploy once it elapses)
  RENDER_API_KEY         – Render API key (required for the active leg /
                            cooldown state to survive a redeploy — see
                            fixed_cycle.py)
  RENDER_SERVICE_ID      – this service's srv-xxxxxxxx id (same as above)
